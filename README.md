## Project Description
* Design, implement, and test an autonomous mobile robot for person
monitoring using a camera.
* The challenge is to assess the relative health of a subject going about their
daily lives based on video analyzed by the robot.
* The robot processes the video using an onboard computer or remote server
and makes a determination about the health of the subject.
* If the robot detects a potential problem, it issues an alert to a remote server.
In any case the robot provides regular reports on the health of its subject.
* Individual robots can “communicate” through the cloud
* This semester – Coordination of Multiple Online Robots
